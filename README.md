### 🎮 NeuroPlay 🕹
🧒🏿🧒🧒🏻 Project that focuses on games to help neurodivergent kids 🧒🏾🧒🏼🧒🏽

## ⚙ Setup:

### 🎲 Run the DB:
1. Run base script (scriptTDAH.sql)
2. Run procedures (proceduresTDAH.sql)
3. Run seeds (seedTDAH.sql)
### 💻 Run the backend:
#### 1. Create a dotenv: 
First of all you should put a .env file in order to make the tokens router work, you may setup yours as it follows:
```
TOKEN_SECRET=SENHASECRETA123 
TOKEN_EXPIRATION=7d
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=root
DB_PASS=root
```
#### 2. Run:
1. Enter the backend folder
2. Run ```npm i``` in order to get dependencies
3. Run ```npm run dev```.
Obs : You should run it in node 14.x version, which is what we used in the backend deploy on Azure and know it works fine.
